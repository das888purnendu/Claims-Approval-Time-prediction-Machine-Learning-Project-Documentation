# Claims-Approval-Time-prediction-Machine-Learning-Project-Documentation

Objective There are certain benefits of using machine learning approach in claim prediction problem: 

• The algorithms can discover patterns from data that is not used in traditional approaches. 

• Due to the automated approach, it can be predicted easily weather a customer can get claims faster or it could delay without using man power, effectively, more accurately. 

• They catch non-linear effects in the data.

• This prediction could reduce customer harassment. 

• Increase work efficiency. 

• Reduce the pressure on the employee of the insurance company. 

• Increase the reliability of the company upon customer.

All of these bullet points translate into improved predictability and greater stability of the claim modelling. Moreover, using artificial intelligence can greatly automate the process, so that specialists can dedicate their time on the results analysis, instead of taking care of sloppy excel calculations. As there is a speedup in the process, the sales representatives can immediately get the expected claim cost based on the past data leading to better sales decisions.
